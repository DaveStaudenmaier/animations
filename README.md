# ractical, real-world animation examples with Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

This project contains examples of practical, real-world animations using Angular: 
- A slide-down animation exposing an Add Post component's template
- A fade in for the new post applied
- A thumbnail photo that will expand smoothly to full-size when clicked and shrink back down when clicked again
- An animation that will draw attention to an element
- Two variations of animation when adding to a dynamic list.  One will fade in.  The other will slide in from the left. 
- Fade animation when changing routes, configured in one place

For a full explanation, see my [Blog](http://dev-reboot/animations).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
